This is a modified version of the Ethernet2 library 
distributed with some newer forks of Arduino (e.g. 1.7.7).
It was derived from the Ethernet library that shipped with Arduino 1.6.5.

Licensing of this library is a legal mess. This author did 
not create the mess but attempts to deal with it herein.

1) www.arduino.cc states that all libraries (such as this one) 
   are licensed under the LGPL.
2) Many files contain no license information at all.
3) Some files contain an MIT or Apache license declaration.

Given the above morass, this author makes the following claims
on licensing:

1) If the file is un-modified from the original version,
   then whatever license applied is still in effect and
   and the LGPL declaration below does not apply (unless the
   original file was already under LGPL; good luck determining
   if that is the case).

2) If the original file is modified and contained no licensing 
   information, then it is licensed under LGPL as stated below.

3) If the original file is modified and contained an another license,
   then it is still licensed under the other license and the 
   LGPL declaration below does not apply.

No licensing information has been removed from the original files.
